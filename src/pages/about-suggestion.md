---

My name is Audun Ase. I've been working as an FX Artist for about 10 years, creating visual effects for film and television. Recently, I made the switch into the gaming industry, which has been an exciting new chapter.

## The Lizards Den

The Lizards Den is my low-stakes, creative space online. It's a place where I can share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and what inspires me—without the pressure of perfectionism.

Here you'll find:
- **Houdini** experiments and workflows
- **Unity** projects and techniques  
- **Blender** explorations
- **Photography** from my spare time
- Occasional ramblings about creative work and the industry

This isn't a portfolio site or a corporate showcase. It's more like a workshop notebook—a place to document the process, share discoveries, and connect with others who are also exploring these tools.

## What to Expect

I'm not here to be an expert or a teacher. I'm here to learn in public, share what I find interesting, and maybe help someone else who's working through similar problems. The posts might be polished tutorials, quick notes, or half-formed thoughts—whatever feels right at the time.

If that sounds like your kind of thing, welcome. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about any of this stuff.
