My name is Audun Ase, I've been working as a FX Artist for about 10 years, but recently switched careers into the gaming industry.

The Lizards Den is my low stakes, creative space online. I primarily write about `Houdini`, `Unity` and `Blender`. There are the occational blog posts about other things that inspire me as well, and I also post pictures as I enjoy photography in my spare time.
