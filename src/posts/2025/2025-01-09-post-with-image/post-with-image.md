The best way I can think of in order to break my sharing congestion is by sharing something personal. 

This is Mango and Moose, the two latest additions to the family. They are still quite young and demand a lot of our attention, but they are aleady an integral part of our family.

## Personality

`Mango` is the level headed one. He's stoic and patient. `Moose` however is dramatic and impatient. He tends to get the wildest zoomies. If you're a pet owner you know what I mean when I say they have such vivid personalities.
I didn't grow up with any animals so I never knew about how different they would be. Sure I had friends with cats, but the neuance is wild. 

I also know that if you don't have a pet you might not care. It's like a parent sharing what their kid did today, over and over.

"Omg, that's crazy!" your childless ass might say. 

But if you like cats I have a bunch of pictures I'd love to share, and I'll only share the ones I think are best.
