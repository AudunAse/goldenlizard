Mango and Moose are the two latest additions to the family. They are still quite young and demand a lot of our attention, but they are aleady an integral part of our family.

## Personality

`Mango` is the level headed one. He's stoic and patient. `Moose` however is dramatic and impatient. He sounds like an F1 car when he has the zoomies. We often call "Box, box!" when he is about to get treats, due to his favorite spot in the kitchen is on a cardboard box. If you're a pet owner you know what I mean when I say they have such vivid personalities.

I know if you don't have a pet you might not care. Sharing stuff our cats did is like a parent sharing what their kid did today, over and over.
"Omg, that's crazy!" your childless ass might say.

Here's the best pictures I've taken of them so far!
