Blender is something I've always knew existed, and tried back in the day. I always knew it was good, but didn't really look into it since I'm a Houdini artist primarily.

I've picked up Blender recently. So this is where I'll be taking note of the stuff I learn that I think is handy!

## Hotkey Cheatsheet

When I forget:

`Ctrl + A` - Apply transforms

`Alt + Z` - Toggle Ghost Mode

`Shift + A` - Create New Mesh

`W` - Toggle Selection Modes

`Tab` - Enter Edit Mode

`P` - Separate, when in Edit Mode

## Cavity Viewport

To get that snazzy edge detail on your models in the viewport, enable `Cavity` under the `Viewport Shading` tab.

It does nothing but look cool.
