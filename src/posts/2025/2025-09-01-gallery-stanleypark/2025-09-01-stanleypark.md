Stanley Park is a large park in Vancouver, Canada BC. The park is a beautiful piece of nature easily accessible for the citizens of Vancouver. 

## Vancouver, BC

I spent 6 years living and working in Vancouver and had numerous photo walks in the park where natural life seem to sprawl. The diversity of animals found there is truly remarkable. This is a selection of photos taken from this time.
