Void Mites, is a game I'm working on in my spare time. It's a "space-like" physics based RTS. It's a colony builder, with a sprinkle of swarm survival. The goal is to grow your colony of crystalline Mites, and fight off corruption to reclaim the void. 

I'm the only developer currently, and It's very early in it's development.
